# **Listyn**

## **Project Description**

**Listyn** is an online repository of music lists from various publications. **Listyn** utilizes the **Spotify Web API** to organize information, and deliver an easy to navigate drop-down menu for every list.

Music publications provide their respective audiences with an endless barrage of "all-time greatest" and "best of this or that year" lists. Often times, the information is difficult to parse through, and requires the user to click or scroll incessantly. Links to purchase or preview the content in question are rarely offered for older lists and rankings. 

**Listyn** offers users a one-stop shop for browsing these lists, and discovering the music they love.

## **The Path Forward**

Below is an overview of my course of action for this project. For a more detailed accounting of the project timeline, please visit the Trello Board section below.  

### **Project Planning**

To begin this project, I created wireframes/rough mockups of my desired end product. These mockups will act as a reminder to prioritize the user experience throughout the development process. I have also done extensive research to confirm that the Spotify API can meet my project's goals.

### **Development Process**

#### First Steps

>• Building the basic HTML structure of an interior list page.

>• Setting up a preliminary CSS Style document.

>• Setting up a preliminary Javascript file. 

#### Core Challenges

>• Completing the OAuth Access Token process. 

>• Accessing the Spotify Web API with Javascript.

>• Retrieving song, artist, album, and album cover data.

#### Next Steps

>• Complete Home and About Us pages.

>• Building out site navigation. 

>• Building out multiple lists from different publications.

>• Making these lists accessible from the home page.

#### Stretch Goals

>• Using CSS, I would like to make the record spin when a song preview is playing. 

>• Include a link to purchase the song or album on Amazon. 

## **User Stories**

#### User Story One

>As a young music fan, I want to familiarize myself with the supposed luminaries of my favorite musical genre. With **Listyn** I can view all the artists from a particular music publication's rankings list, in one easy to use drop-down menu. 

#### User Story Two

>As a long time fan of a genre, I want to know how my favorite songs are viewed by critics today. With **Listyn** I can easily locate a particular song in a given list, and then listen to a preview of the song.
